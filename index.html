      <h2><b>All you need to be a VR developer is the following:</b></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A VR Device (Google Cardboard, GearVr, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)</li>
        <li>Unity (game engine) experience and know-how</li>
        <li>The proper SDK for Unity (based on your VR device)</li>
        <li>C# experience and know-how</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p>
        You can easily learn how to use Unity and code in C# by utilizing online
        courses offered at Udemy, Coursera, or Edx (all within a matter of
        months).
        <br />
        You do NOT need any advanced degrees from a University or large
        development teams. Just learn Unity and C#, get a VR device - and start
        experimenting.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2><b>You should also ask yourself the following questions:</b></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Do I want to be on the front lines of an aggressively growing
          industry?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do I want to develop VR applications that could potentially change
          people’s lives?
        </li>
        <li>How much money and time will I invest in this skill?</li>
        <li>What VR applications do I want to build?</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The Virtual Reality Industry needs developers like you to create
        content. There is a huge range of possible applications you can create
        like games, healthcare apps, and even disaster relief training
        applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Virtual Reality Industry Standards & Terminology:
        <br />
        Why is this important you ask? You should know the industry standards
        and commonalities associated with the development sector. This is
        beneficial for general development and employment. Get familiar with
        these terms as soon as you can.

          with many common scripting languages, it is used to define
          object-oriented (OO) classes or objects in the engine. As you use UE4,
          you’ll often find that objects defined using Blueprint are
          colloquially referred to as just “Blueprints.”

      <h2>What is VR</h2>

        What is virtual reality?
        
        Virtual reality is created by computers that allow you to experience and interact with a3D 
        world that isn’t real by putting on a head-mounted display and some form of input tracking, 
        it will create an immersive, believable experience, allowing you to explore the virtual world being generated by the computer.
        
        Where did virtual reality come from?
        
        The first head-mounted display was named Headlight that was created in the 1960s. 
        The technology has been used for over 200 years from science and medicine to training pilots and helping architects present their latest skyscrapers. 
        VR has plenty of applications and this is only likely to expand as the technology develops further.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Some people believe virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to
        change our lives even more than the smartphone has and that technology
        is developing rapidly. Products like the Oculus Rift have the power to
        immerse users in seamless, real-seeming virtual environments, while
        Google's Cardboard platform can turn your smartphone into a VR machine
        with little more than a few folds of paper. Naturally, such advancements
        go hand in hand with a rising demand for workers, and now might just be
        the right time for interested job seekers to break in. Everyone knows
        the big players in the VR market Oculus, Google and Samsung but the
        majority of jobs are with smaller companies and startups. As the
        industry sees immense growth and adoption, VR developers especially are
        becoming more in-demand. VR industry revenue is expected to jump from
        3.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 to over 40 billion U.S. dollars by
        2020. Another forecast predicts revenue from the global virtual reality
        market to reach 21.5 billion U.S. dollars by 2020.
