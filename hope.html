        <h2> What is VR</h2>
        <p>
            A What is virtual reality? Virtual reality is created by computers that
            allow you to experience and interact with a3D world that isnâ€™t real by
            putting on a head-mounted display and some form of input tracking, it
            will create an immersive, believable experience, allowing you to explore
            the virtual world being generated by the computer. Where did virtual
            reality come from? The first head-mounted display was named Headlight
            that was created in the 1960s. The technology has been used for over 200
            years from science and medicine to training pilots and helping
            architects present their latest skyscrapers. VR has plenty of
            applications and this is only likely to expand as the technology
            develops further.
