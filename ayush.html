    <h2><b>All you need to be a VR developer is the following:</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A VR Device (Google Cardboard, GearVr, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)</li>
      <li>Unity (game engine) experience and know-how</li>
      <li>The proper SDK for Unity (based on your VR device)</li>
      <li>C# experience and know-how</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>
      You can easily learn how to use Unity and code in C# by utilizing online
      courses offered at Udemy, Coursera, or Edx (all within a matter of
      months).
      <br />
      You do NOT need any advanced degrees from a University or large
      development teams. Just learn Unity and C#, get a VR device - and start
      experimenting.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2><b>You should also ask yourself the following questions:</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do I want to be on the front lines of an aggressively growing industry?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do I want to develop VR applications that could potentially change
        people’s lives?
      </li>
      <li>How much money and time will I invest in this skill?</li>
      <li>What VR applications do I want to build?</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Virtual Reality Industry needs developers like you to create content.
      There is a huge range of possible applications you can create like games,
      healthcare apps, and even disaster relief training applications.

      Virtual Reality Industry Standards & Terminology:
      <br />
      Why is this important you ask? You should know the industry standards and
      commonalities associated with the development sector. This is beneficial
      for general development and employment. Get familiar with these terms as
      soon as you can.

        Unreal Engine 4<br />
        UE4 is a complete suite of game development tools. Computationally
        optimized with greater visual fidelity but a steeper learning curve.
        Free to download and use, but as a condition of use they will take 5% of
        your net revenue (above $3000) per quarter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unity 3D<br />
        Unity is a powerful cross-platform 3D engine and a user friendly
        development environment. It’s Easy enough for a beginner and powerful
        enough for an expert. Unity is great for anyone who wants to create
        applications for mobile, desktop, the web, and consoles. Unity has many
        versions with different costs, but Unity Personal is free to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        WebVR<br />
        An experimental Javascript API that provides access to Virtual Reality
        devices. Including HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard, in a web
        browser. Get familiar with these languages, apps, and platforms for
        WebVR.
      </li>
      <li>
        WebVR Boilerplate <br />
        The WebVR boilerplate project is on github, and consists of two parts.
        Firstly, the WebVR polyfill provides WebVR support for
        Cardboard-compatible devices, and orientation tracking fallbacks where
        no headset is available. The WebVR polyfill can also be installed from
        npm (available via npm install webvr-polyfill).

          <li>
            An HMD, provides a reasonable default for interpupillary distance
            and field of view for cardboard-like devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            On mobile devices, a GyroPositionSensorVRDevice, which provides
            orientation through the DeviceOrientationEvent.
          </li>
          <li>
            On PCs, a MouseKeyboardPositionSensorVRDevice, which provides
            orientation through keyboard and mouse events.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        A-Frame <br />
        A web framework for building virtual reality experiences With HTML and

      <li>
        C++ (UE4) <br />
        C++ classes can be used as a base for Blueprint classes, and in this way
        programmers can set up fundamental gameplay classes that are then
        sub-classed and iterated on by level designers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blueprint Visual Scripting (UE4) <br />
        The Blueprints Visual Scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complete
        gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based
        interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor. As with
        many common scripting languages, it is used to define object-oriented
        (OO) classes or objects in the engine. As you use UE4, you’ll often find
        that objects defined using Blueprint are colloquially referred to as
        just “Blueprints.”

      <li>
        C# (Unity) <br />
        A simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language

        Google VR SDK (Unity) <br />
        Build virtual reality applications for Android and iOS using Unity and
        the Google VR SDK. Unity’s native integration with Google VR makes it
        easy to build Android applications for Daydream and Cardboard. The
        Google VR SDK for Unity provides additional features like spatialized
        audio, Daydream controller support, utilities and samples.
